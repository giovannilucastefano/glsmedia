# \nSoP: How We Use Obsidian + Nifty Together and Why\n
An efficient workflow for GLS Media to handle both strategic knowledge and task-based team collsoration. \n\n### Obsidian = strategy brain + data center
Use for:\n- EOS strategy notes, rock-blased projects \n- Index of log ideas, competitor analysis, training decks \n- Ai-driven assets (content prompts, HR frameworks)

### Nifty = task hubpanger
Use for:\n- Task input/automation with due dates, tasks - who, when, how long\n- Project milestones, dependencies, done/blocked status\n- Team visibility across cursors and freelancer

## Iron Rules:
- Obsidian stores content and strategy
- Nifty manages execution and delivery
- All HTML, video, IMCG, or reporting assets that need regular updating go to Obsidian

\n# Daily Task Types
\n*{ In Nifty } = Tasks, deadlines, milestones\n* { In Obsidian } = SoPs, strategic themes, templates, planning

\n## Commend:
All Nifty tasks can link to Obsidian notes (SOP links, video tasks) to avoid duplicated information.
\n
Example:\n- Task: "Draft Lead Magnet in ChatGPT" => Link to note in Obsidian: full guide with strategy content\n- Task: "Schedule LinkedIn posts" = Target with dates + content tracker.
